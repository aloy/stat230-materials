This can be accomplished using intro stat tools such as histograms and summary statistics.\nThe fastest way to get started is using the summary() function, which returns a brief set of summary statistics for each variable in the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR also has built-in functions to compute summary statistics one by one for a specific column. To “extract” a variable from the data set, we use a $. For example, we can extract the critics column from the movies data frame and calculate the standard deviation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther useful summary statistics for quantitative variables include (here x denotes an extracted column):\n\n\n\nFunction\nSummary statistic\n\n\n\n\nmedian(x)\nmedian\n\n\nmean(x)\nmean\n\n\nvar(x)\nvariance\n\n\nIQR(x)\ninterquartile range\n\n\n\n\nTo create graphics in this course we’ll use tools from the {ggformula} R package. All of the functions will begin with gf_ and have similar syntax. If you’re familiar with the {ggplot2} package, feel free to use it for this class, but most students like the “one-liners” that {ggformula} allows.\nTo begin, load the {ggformula} package using the library command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, to create a histogram of the critic’s score we can run\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we use the ~ to tell R that critics is a variable in the data set.

Add xlab = \"Your axis label\" and ylab = \"Your other axis label\" to your scatterplot and give more verbose axis labels.\n\n\n\n\nScatterplots with regression lines\nYou can also add a simple linear regression line to your scatterplot by adding a layer. To add a layer, we append the |&gt; pipe operator to the end of our gf_point() code and use the gf_lm() command to add a line:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\nIf you want a numeric summary of the strength of the linear association between two quantitative variables, then you can calculate the correlation.

Sixty-five college-aged participants (ages 18-25) were recruited and randomly assigned to different sleep conditions ranging from 3 to 9 hours of sleep per night over a one-week period. Each morning, participants completed a computerized simple reaction time task where they responded to visual stimuli as quickly as possible, with reaction times measured in milliseconds. The researchers fit a simple linear regression model to their data and found a slope of -18.7 and a y-intercept of 520.1.\n\nReport the equation of the fitted regression equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\hat{y} = -18.7x + 520.1\\)\n\n\n\n\nInterpret the value of the slope in context.

Briefly justify your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, we should not use the model to predict the reaction time for a young adult who has slept 10 hours per night because this value is outside the range of the data used to fit the model (3 to 9 hours). Predictions made outside the range of the data are considered extrapolations.\n\n\n\n\nWhy did researchers randomly assign participants to a sleep condition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom assignment helps to ensure that any confounding variables are evenly distributed across the different sleep conditions. This allows the researchers to make a causal conclusion about the effect of sleep duration on reaction time.\n\n\n\n\nCan you generalize these results to all young adults in the U.S.? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, we cannot generalize these results to all young adults in the U.S. because it may not be representative of all young adults in the U.S. It we truly wanted to generalize to the entire population, then we should draw a random sample from the population of interest."
