Increasing $x$ by 1 increases (decreases) the median of $Y$ by a factor of $e^\\beta_1$.\n\n## log-transform x only\n\n$\\mu \\lbrace Y | x \\rbrace = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)$\n\nDouble x: $\\mu \\lbrace Y | 2x \\rbrace - \\mu \\lbrace Y | x \\rbrace = \\beta_1 \\log(2)$\n \nA doubling of $x$ is associated with the mean response ($Y$) increasing (decreasing) by $\\beta_1 \\log(2)$ units.\n\nNote that you can use other multiplicative factors other than a doubling. For instance, if you want $x$ to increase by a factor of 1.25 (that is, a 25% increase), then a similar derivation would yield\n\n$\\mu \\lbrace Y | 1.25x \\rbrace - \\mu \\lbrace Y | x \\rbrace = \\beta_1 \\log(1.25)$\n\nIncreasing $x$ by 25% results in the mean of $Y$ increasing (decreasing) by $\\beta_1 \\log(1.25)$ units.\n\n\n## log-transform both Y and x\n\n$\\mu \\lbrace \\log(Y) | x \\rbrace = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)$\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{median of } Y | 2x}{\\text{median of } Y | x} = e^{\\beta_1 \\log(2)} = 2^{\\beta_1}\n$$\n\nThe median of $Y$ at $2x$ is $e^{\\beta_1 \\log(2)}$ times greater (smaller) than the median of $Y$ at $x$. Or equivalently, a doubling of x is associated with the median of Y increasing (decreasing) by a factor of $e^{\\beta_1 \\log(2)}$.\n\nAs above, you can use other multiplicative factors other than a doubling. For a 25% increase,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{median of } Y | 1.25x}{\\text{median of } Y | x} = e^{\\beta_1 \\log(1.25)} = 1.25^{\\beta_1}\n$$\n\n\n## Remarks\n\n1.  Multiplicative changes can also be stated in terms of percentage increases/decreases.\n\n\n- **Ex. 1** The median of Y at 2x is 1.83 times greater than the median of Y at x.\n\n    $(1.83 - 1) \\times 100\\% = 83\\%$\n\n    A doubling of x is associated with an 83\\% increase in the median of Y .\n\n\n- **Ex. 2** The median of Y at 2x is 0.75 times smaller than the median of Y at x.\n\n\n    $(0.75 - 1) \\times 100\\% = -25\\%$\n\n    A doubling of x is associated with a 25\\% decrease in the median of Y\n\n\n2. As noted above, when your explanatory variable is logged, instead of \"doubling x,\" you can use other multiplicative factors.\n\n- **Ex. 3** $\\hat{\\mu} \\lbrace Y | x \\rbrace = 1.4 + 3.1 \\log(x)$\n\n    Suppose you want to consider a 10\\% increase in x, so this corresponds to a factor of $0.10 + 1 = 1.10$.\n\n    $3.1 \\log(1.1) = 0.297$\n\n    A 10\\% increase in x is associated with the mean of Y increasing by about 0.3 units. (Note: this is an additive increase in the mean of Y ).\n\n\n- **Ex. 4** $\\hat{\\mu} \\lbrace \\log(Y) | x \\rbrace = -0.54 - 1.8 \\log(x)$\n\n    Suppose you want to consider a 30\\% increase in x. This corresponds to a multiplicative change of $0.30 + 1 = 1.30$. That is, going from x to 1.3x.\n\n    $e^{-1.8 \\log(1.3)} = 1.3^{-1.8} = 0.6236$.\n\n    A 30\\% increase in x is associated with the median of Y decreasing by a factor of 0.624. \n\n    A 30\\% increase in x is associated with the median of Y decreasing by about 38\\%. $(0.624-1) \\times 100\\%$.\n\n\n## Why the median?\nAfter fitting the transformed model, our regression line gives predictions for the mean of $\\log(Y)$ for a given value of $x$, which we denote $\\mu\\lbrace\\log(Y) | x\\rbrace$. A sketch of what this model looks like is shown below. Notice that on the log scale, the regression line describes the center (the mean) of a symmetric distribution around the regression line.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-transformation-interpretation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen we exponentiate to move back to the original scale we \"distort\" the model. The plot below shows the back-transformed version of the previous plot. Notice that the distributions are no longer symmetric. What was the mean on the log scale corresponds to the median on the original scale. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-transformation-interpretation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOn the univariate scale, consider the following example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](05-transformation-interpretation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow let's back transform and move back to the original scale from the log scale. Back-transforming the mean of log(y) gives us $e^{0.004}=1.004$, which is much closer to the median of y than to the mean.\n",
