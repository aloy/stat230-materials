Researchers collected education level (in years) and income (in thousands of dollars) for a random sample of 32 employees working for the city of Riverview.\n\n\n\nThe researchers fit a simple linear regression of income on education and obtained the following output:\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-align='center'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term        | estimate| std.error| statistic|p.value |\n|:-----------|--------:|---------:|---------:|:-------|\n|(Intercept) |   11.321|     6.123|     1.849|0.074   |\n|education   |    2.651|     0.370|     7.173|<0.001  |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Q1.** Write the fitted regression equation.\n\n**Q2.** Interpret the slope coefficient in the context of the problem. (Don't forget to specify units.)\n\n\n**Q3.** Interpret the intercept in the context of the problem. (Don't forget to specify units.)\n\n\nA new researcher joined the team and decided that education should be standardized (to have mean 0 and SD 1) before fitting the regression model. The output from this regression is shown below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|term             | estimate| std.error| statistic|p.value |\n|:----------------|--------:|---------:|---------:|:-------|\n|(Intercept)      |   53.742|     1.587|    33.861|<0.001  |\n|scale(education) |   11.567|     1.613|     7.173|<0.001  |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Q4.** Write the fitted regression equation for this new model.\n\n**Q5.** Interpret the slope coefficient in the context of the problem. (Don't forget to specify units.)\n\n**Q6.** Interpret the intercept in the context of the problem. (Don't forget to specify units.)\n\n**Q7.** Compare the two models. What's the same? What's different?\n\n\n## Prediction and confidence intervals\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe R code for the following questions is found at <br>\n\n[https://aloy.github.io/stat230-materials/activity/04-slr-prediction](https://aloy.github.io/stat230-materials/activity/04-slr-prediction).\n\nThe URL is also posted on Moodle.\n:::\n\nFor this activity you will consider predicting the price of a used car (it's Kelly Blue Book value) based on its mileage. The columns of interest in the `Cars` data set are `Price` and `Mileage`.\n\n\n**Q1.** Use the `lm()` command to fit the simple linear regression\nmodel where Mileage is used to predict Price. Report the fitted regression equation.\n\n\n**Q2.** The first car in the data set is a Buick Century with 8221\nmiles. Calculate the expected price of this car using the fitted regression equation. \n\n**Q3.** If we want to predict the price of **this** car, should we use a confidence interval or a prediction interval?\n\n**Q4.** Use R to construct the appropriate 89% interval for the price of this car. Record this interval below.\n\n\n**Q5.** Interpret the interval in context.\n\n\n**Q6.** Run the code to produce a scatterplot, regression line, and both types of intervals. Which is the prediction interval and which is the confidence interval? How can you tell?\n\n",
