Knowing the age of abalone can help set sustainable fishing quotas; however, the process is time consuming and labor intensive. Researchers collected various physical measurements, such as length, diameter, height, and weight, that are easy to collect to develop a method to predict abalone age. Below is R output for a multiple linear regression model predicting rings (a proxy for age) that uses `length` (mm), `diameter` (mm), `height` (mm), and `whole_weight` (in grams) as predictor variables.\n\n```\nCall:\nlm(formula = rings ~ length + diameter + height + whole_weight, \n    data = abalone)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)    2.90861    0.30922   9.406  < 2e-16\nlength       -12.04857    2.10217  -5.731 1.07e-08\ndiameter      25.64381    2.57384   9.963  < 2e-16\nheight        20.24276    1.78180  11.361  < 2e-16\nwhole_weight   0.06589    0.22557   0.292     0.77    \n---\n\nResidual standard error: 2.59 on 4172 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.3556,\tAdjusted R-squared:  0.3549 \nF-statistic: 575.4 on 4 and 4172 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n```\n\n(a) Report the estimated regression equation.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nThe estimated regression equation is:\n$$\\widehat{rings} = 2.90861 - 12.04857(\\mathtt{length}) + 25.64381(\\mathtt{diameter}) + 20.24276(\\mathtt{height}) + 0.06589(\\mathtt{whole\\_weight})$$\n:::\n\n(b) Using the model, predict the number of rings for an abalone with length 0.5 mm, diameter 0.4 mm, height 0.1 mm, and whole weight of 1 gram.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nTo make the prediction, we substitute the values into the regression equation:\n$$\n\\widehat{rings} = 2.90861 - 12.04857(0.5) + 25.64381(0.4) + 20.24276(0.1) + 0.06589(1) = 9.23 \\text{ rings}\n$$\n:::\n\n(c) Interpret the slope coefficient for length in context.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nThe slope coefficient for length is -12.04857. This means that, holding all other predictor variables constant, for each additional millimeter increase in length, we expect the number of rings to decrease by approximately 12.05.\n::: \n\n(d) State the hypotheses for the test of the slope coefficient for `whole_weight`. What do you conclude based on the results of this test?\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nThe hypotheses for the test of the slope coefficient for `whole_weight` are:\n\n- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): $\\beta_{\\text{whole\\_weight}} = 0$ (there is no association between whole weight and rings, controlling for other variables)  \n- Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): $\\beta_{\\text{whole\\_weight}} \\neq 0$ (there is an association between whole weight and rings, controlling for other variables)\n\nThe p-value for the test is 0.77, which is very large. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence to suggest that whole weight is associated with the number of rings, after accounting for length, diameter, and height.\n:::\n\n(e) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient for `length`. Interpret this interval in context.\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nTo calculate the 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient for `length`, we use the\nformula:\n\n$$\\text{CI} = \\hat{\\beta} \\pm t^* \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\beta})$$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\beta}$ is the estimated coefficient, $SE(\\hat{\\beta})$ is the standard error, and $t^*$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with 4172 degrees of freedom.\n\nUsing the output, we have:\n\n- $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{length}} = -12.04857$\n- $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{length}}) = 2.10217$\n- For a 95% confidence level and 4172 degrees of freedom, $t^* \\approx 1.96$ (using normal approximation for large df) \n\nThus, the confidence interval is:\n$$\\text{CI} = -12.04857 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot 2.10217 =  (-16.169,  -7.928)$$\n\nWe are 95% confident that the true slope coefficient for length is between -16.169 and -7.928. We are 95% confident that for each additional millimeter increase in length, the number of rings is expected to decrease by between 7.93 and 16.17,  holding all other variables constant.\n:::\n\n(f) What proportion of the variability in `rings` is explained by the model?\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Solution\nThe proportion of variability in `rings` explained by the model is given by the R-squared value, which is 0.3556. This means that approximately 35.56% of the variability in the number of rings can be explained by the multiple regression model with the predictor variables length, diameter, height, and whole weight.\n:::",
