To guide you through this process, let's revisit the Framingham Heart Study data set that we discussed in class.\n\nTo load the data, run the following code chunk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nframingham <- read.csv(\"https://aloy.github.io/stat230-materials/data/framingham.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBinary logistic regression requires a binary response variable. In this case, we will use the `TenYearCHD` variable, which indicates whether an individual developed coronary heart disease within ten years (1 = yes, 0 = no). Be sure to always check that your response variable is coded correctly before modeling.\n\n\nNext, we will fit a binary logistic regression model using the `glm()` function in R. The syntax is similar to that of the `lm()` function, but we need to specify the `family` argument as `binomial` to indicate that we are performing logistic regression. Here, we will model the probability of developing coronary heart disease based on age.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nlogistic_model <- glm(TenYearCHD ~ age, data = framingham, family = binomial)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can still use the `summary()` function to view the results of the model fit:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n```{webr}\nsummary(logistic_model)\n```\n:::\n\n\nMuch of the regression output looks the same as in linear regression, but there are some key differences. The main differences are:\n\n- The test statistic is no labeled `z value` instead of `t value`.\n- A `Null deviance` and `Residual deviance` are reported instead of `Multiple R-squared` and `Adjusted R-squared`.\n\nWe'll discuss the use and interpretation of these results in more detail in class.\n\n\n\n",
